## BeaconPlus

This is a Perl-based server implementation to test the Beacon protocol(s).

While this could be the basis for a [fully functional Beacon installation/ui/](http://beacon.progenetix.org) (w/o authentication, but added features from the roadmap).

If you're interested in a deployment, please contact @mbaudis for more information (e.g. MongoDB setup, example data ...).
